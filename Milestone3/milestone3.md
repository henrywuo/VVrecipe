### Changes from milestone 2
Our UI has improved compared to Milestone 2 by the advice of our TA. We moved the VegHub logo onto the navbar and removed the Home button for the sake of simplicity. In Milestone 2, we had issues with the navbar and banner images not covering the entire width of the screen. We modified this so it would cover it properly. We've started our initial work on creating posts that people can upload with recipes and pictures of their food by using Bootstrap cards. In the recipe page, the recipe cards would go off the screen. We've improved this aspect so that no horizontal scrolling would occur.
