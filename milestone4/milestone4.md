### How your UI's screenshots have improved upon the versions shown in milestone3.md in a noticeable way
In milestone3, we didn't have a carousel slide, but now we finally implemented it. The slide changes automatically byt we included left and right buttons to change the carousel and it works now. </br>The upload button works and updates the grid of picture on the homepage. Each picture on the grid is hoverable and will show the recipe name. The log in and sign in page now works and people needs to make an account to upload recipes. We included a comment functionality into the homepage.


### Core functionalities
* The Upload button is correctly functioning. It uploads a picture of the recipe dish, description about dish and the ingredients to the dish. Uploading a recipe will update the image grid on the home page and the recipe page.
