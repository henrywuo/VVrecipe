### How someone in your target user population would use your app
Bob is looking over vegan food on Instagram and found some delicious looking food. He decided that he wants to recreate it for himself but a problem arose. The person who posted pictures of the food only posted pictures of the food but did not list any recipe or ingredients.</br> Bob didn't give up so he decided to try to find the recipe for the dishes he saw. He came across the vegan/vegetarian site VegHub. On the site, Bob can enjoy looking at all the homemade recipe people are sharing on the page. When he clicks on them he is able to find ingredients and recipe for the pictures. Now Bob is able to recreate what the vegan dishes that looks delicious from the photos  and share them with his friends.
